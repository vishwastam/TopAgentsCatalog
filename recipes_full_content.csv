Prompt Chaining,"When faced with a complex multi-step task, breaking it into sequential prompts can simplify the problem for the model. A prompt chaining agent tackles a problem step by step, where the output of one LLM call feeds into the next. This avoids overwhelming a single prompt with complexity. For example, Anthropic notes that prompt chaining clarifies tasks by having the LLM solve subtasks in order. In practice, the agent might first outline an answer and then refine it in stages. This approach solves tasks like document drafting or coding by iteratively expanding on partial results, keeping each step manageable and improving consistency.","Developers, Data Scientists","Clarifies complex tasks by solving subtasks in sequence, reducing cognitive load on the model",https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-engineering
Routing,"Tasks often vary by type (e.g., translation vs. coding vs. QA). A routing agent first classifies input and then sends it to the specialized sub-agent best suited for that task. The problem it solves is that one-size-fits-all prompts fail across diverse requests. Anthropic describes routing as directing inputs to specialized models or prompts based on content. For instance, the agent might detect a math question and use a calculation model, or recognize a creative prompt and switch to a more imaginative model. This solves accuracy by matching task types to optimal handling, improving both speed and quality across diverse workflows.","AI Engineers, Product Managers","Directs inputs to specialized models based on content type, improving task-specific performance",https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-engineering
Parallelization,"When different parts of a task can be done simultaneously, parallelization speeds up processing. A parallel agent splits the task into independent threads and calls multiple LLMs in parallel. Anthropic explains that this is effective for subtasks that can run concurrently or to gather diverse answers. For example, the agent might generate multiple answers in parallel and then combine or vote on them. This solves latency and can improve quality through redundancy. The pattern works well for tasks like generating multiple creative options, fact-checking across sources, or processing large datasets where independence allows simultaneous work.","Software Engineers, Operations Teams","Speeds up processing by running independent tasks simultaneously, reducing latency",https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-engineering
Orchestrator-Workers,"Complex tasks with unpredictable subtasks require dynamic breakdown. An orchestrator-workers agent acts as a manager LLM that decomposes the input on the fly and assigns subtasks to other agents. Anthropic calls this ideal when you can't predict the subtasks needed. For example, in a large coding problem, the orchestrator may first decide to write a user interface module and then backend logic, each handled by specialized worker agents. This solves coordination by having a central planner that can adapt the workflow based on intermediate results, making it suitable for open-ended or exploratory tasks.","Engineering Managers, System Architects","Dynamically breaks down complex problems and assigns work to specialized agents",https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-engineering
Evaluator-Optimizer,"Ensuring answer quality can be hard in one pass. The evaluator-optimizer agent addresses this by adding a feedback loop. One LLM generates a response and another evaluates it and suggests improvements. Anthropic describes this loop of generation and critique. For example, a translation agent might produce a draft and then a second agent checks for mistakes. This iterative review solves errors: each cycle refines the output. The pattern is especially valuable for high-stakes tasks where quality matters more than speed, like legal document review or medical diagnosis assistance.","Quality Assurance, Content Creators","Improves output quality through iterative feedback and refinement cycles",https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-engineering
Autonomous Agent,"Some tasks have no fixed steps and require continuous control. An autonomous agent operates independently on an objective, planning and acting over multiple turns. Anthropic explains that such agents plan and operate independently, using feedback at each step. For instance, an autonomous coding agent might iteratively modify code and test it until the task is done. This solves open-ended problems by letting the agent adapt its approach based on results. The pattern works for tasks like research projects, creative writing, or system administration where the exact sequence of actions can't be predetermined.","Researchers, System Administrators","Enables independent operation on open-ended tasks with adaptive planning",https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-engineering
Reflection Pattern,"LLMs may make logical mistakes without self-review. A reflection agent periodically asks the model to examine its own reasoning. The problem it solves is unchecked errors in chain-of-thought. In this pattern, the agent instructs the LLM to articulate its thought process and then verify or correct it. For example, after generating a solution, the agent might ask 'Is this reasoning sound?' or 'What could go wrong with this approach?' This metacognitive step catches errors and improves answer reliability, especially for complex reasoning tasks where initial intuition might be flawed.","Analysts, Researchers","Reduces reasoning errors through self-examination and verification",https://www.promptingguide.ai/
Tool Use Pattern,"LLMs lack direct access to real-time data or calculations. A tool-use agent integrates external APIs (search, calculators, databases) into the reasoning loop. The problem it solves is providing factual accuracy. When needed, the agent decides to call a tool. For example, for a weather query the agent might call a weather API instead of guessing. This solves hallucination by grounding responses in real data. The pattern enables agents to be both conversational and factually accurate, combining language understanding with access to current, verified information sources.","Data Analysts, Customer Service","Provides factual accuracy by integrating real-time data and calculations",https://www.promptingguide.ai/
ReAct Pattern,"Certain problems benefit from alternating reasoning and action. A ReAct agent interleaves chain-of-thought with explicit actions (like web search or database queries). The issue it solves is incomplete reasoning. According to the Prompt Engineering Guide, combining reasoning with tool calls achieves better performance. For example, if asked a factual question, the agent might first think, then perform a search action, then reason about the results. This creates a feedback loop where actions inform reasoning and vice versa, leading to more thorough and accurate problem-solving than pure reasoning or pure action alone.","Information Workers, Research Assistants","Combines reasoning with actions for more comprehensive problem-solving",https://www.promptingguide.ai/
Plan-and-Execute Agent,"Large tasks often need an explicit roadmap. A plan-and-execute agent first generates a structured plan, then carries it out. The problem it solves is redundant LLM reasoning. In this approach, one part of the system (often a larger model) produces an outline of steps, then smaller models or tools execute them. For instance, for 'analyze this dataset,' the agent might plan: 1) load data, 2) check for missing values, 3) generate summary statistics, 4) create visualizations. This separation allows optimization: planning can use expensive models while execution uses faster, cheaper ones.","Project Managers, Data Scientists","Separates high-level planning from execution for efficient resource use",https://docs.langchain.com/
Single-Agent System,"Some problems can be handled by one versatile agent. In a single-agent system, one LLM is given all tools and instructions to complete the task end-to-end. The problem it solves is simplicity: small tasks may not need coordination. For example, a single chatbot agent could both reason about a query and call a search API if needed. This works well for well-defined problems where the scope is manageable. The advantage is reduced complexity and easier debugging, while the limitation is scalability to very large or specialized tasks that might benefit from division of labor.","Small Teams, Individual Contributors","Simplifies implementation for manageable tasks without coordination overhead",https://platform.openai.com/
Multi-Agent System,"When workflows are large or specialized, multiple agents collaborate. A multi-agent stack divides the task among several LLM modules. The problem it solves is scaling complexity. Agents can work in parallel on subtasks and then aggregate outputs. For example, one agent could summarize documents while another checks facts and a third formats the final report. This allows specialization: each agent can be optimized for its specific role. The pattern scales to handle enterprise-level workflows that would overwhelm a single agent, though it requires careful orchestration.","Enterprise Teams, Complex Workflows","Scales to handle large, specialized workflows through division of labor",https://platform.openai.com/
AI App Builder Agent,"Writing boilerplate app code is tedious for developers. Replit's AI app-builder agent automates app creation from a high-level description. It solves the problem of manual setup by scaffolding an entire codebase. For example, given 'build a portfolio website,' the agent generates all needed files (HTML/CSS/JS) instantly. This accelerates development: developers get a runnable prototype in minutes. The agent understands common app patterns and can set up databases, authentication, and deployment configuration automatically, turning ideas into working applications with minimal manual coding.","Developers, Entrepreneurs","Accelerates development by automating boilerplate code and setup",https://docs.replit.com/
Coding Agent,"Complex software tasks span many files and edits, which is error-prone. A coding agent automates these tasks by breaking them into steps and using tests to guide corrections. The agent solves coordination by iteratively editing code and verifying it. For instance, it might first fix a bug in one file, run tests to check for regressions, then update related files as needed. This systematic approach reduces errors and handles complexity that would overwhelm manual editing. The agent can work across entire codebases while maintaining consistency and catching integration issues early.","Software Developers, DevOps Engineers","Automates complex code changes with systematic testing and verification",https://www.anthropic.com/
Computer Control Agent,"Some tasks require controlling software or machines directly. A computer control agent equips an LLM with interfaces (like mouse/keyboard APIs) to operate computers. The problem it solves is automating GUI or system interactions. For example, if asked to gather stock data from a website, the agent can open a browser and click through the site under LLM guidance. This enables automation of tasks that lack APIs, allowing agents to work with any software a human could use. The pattern is powerful for legacy systems or complex multi-step processes that cross application boundaries.","Automation Engineers, QA Testers","Automates GUI and system interactions for comprehensive task automation",https://www.anthropic.com/
Lead Generation Agent,"Sales teams need to engage prospects efficiently. A lead generation agent automates initial outreach and qualification by chatting with visitors or callers. The problem it solves is freeing reps from repetitive inquiries. For example, the agent greets site visitors, asks qualifying questions, and schedules appointments. It captures names and needs, then books meetings if they qualify. This improves efficiency: sales reps focus on qualified leads while the agent handles initial filtering. The system can operate 24/7 and consistently applies qualification criteria, increasing both lead volume and quality.","Sales Teams, Marketing Professionals","Automates prospect engagement and qualification to improve sales efficiency",https://www.botpress.com/
Enterprise Support Agent,"Handling high support volumes is expensive. An enterprise support agent automates routine help queries via chat. This solves the problem of overwhelming human staff. The agent reads a question, searches a knowledge base, and responds immediately. In practice, such agents can resolve a large fraction of Tier-1 tickets. For example, Zendesk's AI solved ~40% of support requests on its own. This reduces costs while improving response times. The agent handles common issues instantly while escalating complex problems to human experts, optimizing the entire support workflow.","Customer Support, IT Help Desk","Reduces support costs while improving response times for common issues",https://www.zendesk.com/
Competitive Intelligence Agent,"Keeping up with competitors manually is slow. A competitive intelligence agent continuously scans competitors' websites and news, alerting businesses to relevant changes. It solves the problem of manual monitoring. For example, the agent watches rival product pages and pricing, identifying changes automatically. This provides timely insights that inform strategic decisions. The agent can track dozens of competitors simultaneously, noting product launches, pricing changes, and marketing campaigns. This comprehensive monitoring would be impossible manually but becomes feasible with automated agents.","Strategy Teams, Product Managers","Provides timely competitive insights through automated monitoring",https://www.botpress.com/
Content Discovery Agent,"Personalizing content at scale is challenging. A content discovery agent curates a custom feed for each user by analyzing preferences. For example, Pinterest's AI uses an agent to pick pins based on user history and content metadata. The problem it solves is overwhelming content volume. The agent learns a user's interests and then re-ranks items accordingly, showing more of what they like. This dynamic recommendation improves engagement and user satisfaction while helping platforms surface relevant content from vast catalogs.","Content Platforms, Media Companies","Personalizes content discovery to improve user engagement and satisfaction",https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering
Trend Forecasting Agent,"Retailers must predict which trends will be popular. A trend forecasting agent scans social media, sales data, and news to spot emerging patterns. It solves the lag of manual trend analysis. For instance, the agent monitors online images and tags, identifying rising fashion trends faster than traditional methods. This allowed designers to react quickly to what consumers like. The agent continuously processes vast amounts of unstructured data to detect weak signals that human analysts might miss, providing early warning of market shifts.","Retail, Fashion Industry","Identifies emerging trends faster than manual analysis for competitive advantage",https://www.mckinsey.com/
Travel Planning Agent,"Creating personalized trip itineraries is time-consuming. A travel planning agent automates this by retrieving current data and combining it with traveler preferences. The problem it solves is manual research. The agent fetches live flight, hotel, and event data and tailors suggestions to the customer's history. For example, it could find a cheaper flight or popular local events. This improves both efficiency and personalization: travelers get customized recommendations without the research burden, while travel companies can offer more tailored service at scale.","Travel Industry, Hospitality","Automates personalized trip planning with real-time data and preferences",https://skift.com/
HR Support Agent,"HR departments receive many routine inquiries about benefits and policies that tie up resources. An HR support agent answers common employee questions instantly. It solves the problem of repetitive queries. For example, a Slack chatbot answers FAQs about PTO and security, searching a company knowledge base and responding in real-time. This improves employee experience while freeing HR staff for strategic work. The agent provides consistent answers and can handle multiple inquiries simultaneously, improving both efficiency and employee satisfaction.","Human Resources, Employee Support","Improves employee experience while freeing HR staff for strategic work",https://www.botpress.com/
Financial Advisor Agent,"Financial advisors need fast insights in client meetings. A financial advisor agent fetches relevant data and suggests strategies on demand. It solves the lag in manual research. For instance, during volatile markets, the agent retrieved updated financial data and used it to generate talking points. Advisors could then answer client questions on interest rate changes quickly. This saved preparation time and ensured advisors had current information. The agent combines market data with client profiles to provide personalized, timely advice that enhances client relationships.","Financial Services, Wealth Management","Provides timely financial insights and personalized advice for client meetings",https://www.jpmorgan.com/
Route Optimization Agent,"Delivery companies must plan routes that change in real time. A route optimization agent continuously recalculates routes using live data. It solves inefficiencies of static planning. For example, UPS's ORION system updates drivers' routes with current traffic and delivery information. This adaptation greatly reduces mileage and fuel. Instead of one fixed route, the agent reorders stops when conditions change, finding the most efficient path dynamically. This real-time optimization saves millions in fuel costs while improving delivery times.","Logistics, Delivery Services","Reduces costs and improves delivery times through real-time route optimization",https://www.ups.com/
