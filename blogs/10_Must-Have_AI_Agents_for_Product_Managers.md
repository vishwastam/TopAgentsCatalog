# 10 Must-Have AI Agents for Product Managers

Product managers juggle roadmaps, user research, backlog grooming, and stakeholder communication. AI agents are now stepping in to automate routine tasks and surface insights, giving PMs more time for strategy. Here are 10 real-world AI agents PMs should explore in 2025:

1. **Notion AI** – Drafts PRDs, summarizes meeting notes, and auto-generates user stories.
2. **Otter.ai** – Transcribes meetings in real time and highlights action items.
3. **ChatPDF** – Summarizes research docs and specs conversationally.
4. **Productboard AI** – Prioritizes features based on sentiment and business impact.
5. **AirOps** – Automates spreadsheets to dashboards with minimal engineering.
6. **Jira Assistant** – Tags and triages tickets using ML patterns.
7. **Figma Chat** – Suggests design changes and layout ideas inside Figma.
8. **Perplexity.ai** – Helps with market research and competitive insights.
9. **Copy.ai** – Writes release notes and product marketing copy.
10. **GitHub Copilot** – Assists PMs with scripts, markdown, and automation tasks.

**How to Use Them**

- Start with time sinks: meetings, specs, and grooming.
- Test 2–3 agents in a sprint and evaluate saved hours.
- Build a lightweight AI toolkit for your product pod.

These tools won't replace PMs, but they'll absolutely make your day 3x faster.
