# 10 Must-Have AI Agents for Product Managers

Product managers (PMs) juggle myriad responsibilities—from defining roadmaps to gathering user feedback to coordinating cross-functional teams. According to the 2024 **Product Management Benchmark** report by Pendo, PMs spend **30–40%** of their time on administrative tasks and content creation, detracting from strategic activities¹.
